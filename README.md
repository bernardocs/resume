##About me
I'm a developer traveling the road to design.
Not long ago, I was working as a backend developer for almost 4 years until I started to get serious into UI and UX. I've been in love with it since then... Of course, I still like doing backend stuff, but UI design, UX is just way more amazing.

Even though I'm currently at UI/UX I still very interested in AI, Machine Learning, Compilers, Distributed Systems, Parallel Programming and some other stuff.

I also always search the best practices of whatever I'm doing. I think that's the most effective way to head to a professional knowledge.

I also actively participates on meetups and talks. Community is such a beautiful thing. ;D

##Work Experience

**Frontend UI developer** - [Avanti!](http://www.penseavanti.com.br) - February 2016 - March 2016

> Basically done a bunch of screens (only UI... there's was another guy to handle the Angular.js) in a short amount of time. Pretty intense and nice. Learned a lot with it.

**Analyst Developer** - [Infobase](http://www.infobase.com.br) - November 2014 - May 2015

> I worked in (probably) the bigger project that I've have ever put my hands on: a huge recruitement of a company called Teleperformance. Did a lot of frontend stuff (which triggered my interest in UI and UX) and backend in .NET (mainly C#).

**Web Developer** - [STI](http://www.sti.uff.br) - April 2014 - September 2014

> STI is responsable for my university academic system. Mostly Java web backend stuff... EJB, JSF, JPA2, Spring.

**Junior Analyst Developer** - [PixelHouse](http://www.pixelhouse.com.br) - July 2012 - January 2013

> They had a lot of manual processes so I was assigned to do a lot of automatizations in C#. They had, also, a huge database. I learned a lot from there...

**Intern** - [Caelum](http://www.caelum.com.br) - November 2010 - January 2012

> Caelum is a nice company that offers technical courses. Everything I know today, including good practices, agile, Java web development, HTML5, Git, etc, I learned there. They also have a huge presence in the community and also influenced me to participate in Dojos and Meetups. Good memories, indeed.

**Intern** - Brazilian Navy - September 2009 - March 2010

> I helped with the structural cabling and the computers maintenances. No code at all. Boring (and it didn't even count as activity hours for my tech highschool). But I learned a lot about basic infrastructure and a little bit about network. I've setup a Novel file server and a Lotus Notes mail server.
