## Work Experience
**Software engineer** @ [Linx Impulse](https://www.linx.com.br/transformacao-digital/linx-impulse/) - September 2018 - Present

> I was assigned to work with the Data Lake team and build the frontend of a CRM product. After the project moved on to another team I stayed with Data Lake team, learning and working through some batch distributed processes and, as a frontend of course, some UI. Today I work with a team that I was invited to build the frontend of a product that categorizes products.

**Frontend engineer** @ [Dzigual Golinelli](http://www.dzigual.com.br/) - June 2016 - September 2017

> I'm assigned to head the frontend of a catalog/email marketing WYSIWYG editor. Learned a lot about projects archtecture and organization, bundlers, etc. As well as for CI and code review.

**Frontend developer** @ [Shaw and Partners](http://www.shawandpartners.com) - March 2016 - June 2016

> Handled the front (UI and Engeneering) of a quiz builder project. Worked a **lot** with Angular. I also did some graphs using HTML Canvas. Neat!

**Frontend UI developer** @ [Avanti!](http://www.penseavanti.com.br) - February 2016 - March 2016

> Basically done a bunch of screens (only UI... there's was another guy to handle the Angular.js) in a short amount of time. Pretty intense and nice. Worked directly with HTML5 and CSS3, using SCSS and Grunt.

**Analyst Developer** @ [Infobase](http://www.infobase.com.br) - November 2014 - May 2015

> I worked in (probably) the biggest project that I've have ever put my hands on up to that point: a huge recruitement system of a company called Teleperformance. Did a lot of frontend stuff (which made me interested on that career) and backend in .NET (mainly C#).

**Web Developer** @ [STI](http://www.sti.uff.br) - April 2014 - September 2014

> STI is responsable for UFF academic system. Mostly Java web backend: EJB, JSF, JPA2, Spring. I took care of two systems: Academic tutoring and the scientific initiation scholarship management systems.

**Junior Analyst Developer** @ [PixelHouse](http://www.pixelhouse.com.br) - July 2012 - January 2013

> They had a lot of manual processes so I was assigned to do a lot of automatizations in C#. They had, also, a huge database. I learned a lot from there... I resigned when I got accepted on the Federal Fluminense University. Not only the work place and the university were far of each other but the university schedule had far too many conflicts with my working hours.

**Intern** @ [Caelum](http://www.caelum.com.br) - November 2010 - January 2012

> Caelum is a nice company that offers technical courses. Everything I know today, including good practices, agile, Java web development, HTML5, Git, etc, I learned there. They also have a huge presence in the community and also influenced me to participate in Dojos and Meetups. Good memories, indeed. First, I was supposed to help with the infra... as all the computers there had Ubuntu on it, it was a cool first experience handling Linux (in love with it since then). I was allowed to participate on courses with vacancy and I did a lot of them. Java, Java Web, EJB, JPA2, Agile, etc.

**Intern** - Brazilian Navy - September 2009 - March 2010

> I helped with the structural cabling and the computers maintenances. No code at all. Boring (and it didn't even count as activity hours for my tech highschool). But I learned a lot about basic infrastructure and a little bit about network. I've setup a Novel file server and a Lotus Notes mail server.
