## Work Experience
**Senior software engineer** @ [Swing Development](https://swing.dev/) - March 2021 - October 2023

> I began my involvement by contributing to a few small projects through outsourcing. Subsequently, I was assigned to work with [Hippo](https://www.hippo.com/), specifically focusing on the Customer Portal backend and supporting other significant upcoming projects. The company had a well-established technological ecosystem, employing NestJS, TypeScript, and GraphQL. My role centered on utilizing the existing automated infrastructure based on AWS, Terraform, and Ansible, which facilitated a more efficient development process and upheld a commitment to quality.

**Software engineer** @ [Linx Impulse](https://www.linx.com.br/transformacao-digital/linx-impulse/) - September 2018 - February 2021

> I was assigned to collaborate with the Data Lake team, where I played a key role in constructing the frontend for a CRM product. After the project shifted to another team, I continued my involvement with the Data Lake team, delving into batch distributed processes and contributing to UI development as a frontend specialist. Subsequently, I received an invitation to lead the frontend development of a product designed to categorize items within the Data Lake.

**Frontend engineer** @ [Dzigual Golinelli](http://www.dzigual.com.br/) - June 2016 - September 2017

> I was leading the frontend development efforts for a WYSIWYG editor focused on catalog and email marketing. In this role, I have gained extensive experience in project architecture, organization, bundlers, and various aspects of continuous integration (CI) and code review processes.

**Frontend developer** @ [Shaw and Partners](http://www.shawandpartners.com) - March 2016 - June 2016

> Managed the frontend aspects (UI and Engineering) of a quiz builder project in Angular.js. I also utilized HTML Canvas to craft efficient graphs.

**Frontend UI developer** @ [Avanti!](http://www.penseavanti.com.br) - February 2016 - March 2016

> Successfully developed numerous UI screens within a tight timeframe, collaborating closely with a colleague responsible for Angular.js. Executed tasks efficiently and adeptly, employing direct expertise in HTML5 and CSS3, with a focus on SCSS and Grunt for streamlined development processes.

**Analyst Developer** @ [Infobase](http://www.infobase.com.br) - November 2014 - May 2015

> Engaged in what is likely the most substantial project I had encountered at that timeâ€”contributing significantly to the development of a vast recruitment system for Teleperformance. Primarily focused on frontend tasks, which sparked my keen interest in this career path, and concurrently handled backend responsibilities using .NET, predominantly with C#.

**Web Developer** @ [STI](http://www.sti.uff.br) - April 2014 - September 2014

> As a contributor within STI, the sector responsible for overseeing UFF's academic systems, I actively engaged with Java web backend technologies, namely EJB, JSF, and JPA2, along with Spring. My responsibilities encompassed the management of two essential systems: Academic Tutoring and Scientific Initiation Scholarship.

**Junior Analyst Developer** @ [PixelHouse](http://www.pixelhouse.com.br) - July 2012 - January 2013

> I was tasked with streamlining numerous manual processes by implementing automation solutions in C# due to the extensive reliance on manual procedures in the organization. Additionally, I worked with a substantial database, gaining valuable insights and experience. Ultimately, I resigned from the position upon receiving acceptance to Federal Fluminense University. The decision was influenced by the considerable distance between my workplace and the university, as well as the frequent scheduling conflicts between my university commitments and work hours.

**Intern** @ [Caelum](http://www.caelum.com.br) - November 2010 - January 2012

> Caelum is a wonderful company specializing in technical courses. It has been instrumental in shaping my current knowledge, encompassing various areas such as good practices, agile methodologies, Java web development, HTML5, Git, and more. My learning journey at Caelum extended beyond formal courses to community engagement, where their strong presence inspired me to actively participate in Dojos and Meetups.
> Initially, my role involved contributing to the infrastructure. This marked my first exposure to Linux, as all the computers operated on Ubuntu. This experience sparked a genuine interest in Linux that has persisted ever since. Additionally, I had the opportunity to enroll in various courses, covering subjects such as Java, Java Web, EJB, JPA2, Agile, and more. These experiences at Caelum have left me with fond memories and a wealth of knowledge.

**Intern** - Brazilian Navy - September 2009 - March 2010

> My role primarily involved assisting with structural cabling and computer maintenance, devoid of any coding tasks. Due to the lack of coding activities, these responsibilities, unfortunately, did not contribute to my technical high school's activity hours. However, the experience was far from mundane, as it provided me with valuable insights into basic infrastructure and a modest understanding of networking.
> During this period, I successfully configured a Novel file server and a Lotus Notes mail server, further broadening my practical skills and knowledge in the field.
