##About me
I'm a developer traveling the road to design.
Not long ago, I was working as a backend developer for almost 4 years until I started to get serious into UI and UX. I've been in love with it since then... Of course, I still like doing backend stuff, but UI design, UX is just way more amazing.

Even though I'm currently at UI/UX I still very interested in AI, Machine Learning, Compilers, Distributed Systems, Parallel Programming and some other stuff.

I also always search the best practices of whatever I'm doing. I think that's the most effective way to head to a professional knowledge.

I also actively participates on meetups and talks. Community is such a beautiful thing. ;D

##Work Experience

**Frontend UI developer** - [Avanti!](http://www.penseavanti.com.br) - February 2016 - March 2016

> Basically done a bunch of screens (only UI... there's was another guy to handle the Angular.js) in a short amount of time. Pretty intense and nice. Worked directly with HTML5 and CSS3, using SCSS and Grunt.

**Analyst Developer** - [Infobase](http://www.infobase.com.br) - November 2014 - May 2015

> I worked in (probably) the bigger project that I've have ever put my hands on: a huge recruitement of a company called Teleperformance. Did a lot of frontend stuff (which triggered my interest in UI and UX) and backend in .NET (mainly C#). It was pretty intense since I already joined the team when the project was already 2 month late, but was a really nice experience.

**Web Developer** - [STI](http://www.sti.uff.br) - April 2014 - September 2014

> STI is responsable for my university academic system. Mostly Java web backend stuff... EJB, JSF, JPA2, Spring. I took care of two systems: Academic tutoring and the scientific initiation scholarship management systems.

**Junior Analyst Developer** - [PixelHouse](http://www.pixelhouse.com.br) - July 2012 - January 2013

> They had a lot of manual processes so I was assigned to do a lot of automatizations in C#. They had, also, a huge database. I learned a lot from there... I resigned when I got a vacancy in the Federal Fluminense University. Not only the work place and the university were far of each other but the university schedule had far too many conflicts with my working hours.

**Intern** - [Caelum](http://www.caelum.com.br) - November 2010 - January 2012

> Caelum is a nice company that offers technical courses. Everything I know today, including good practices, agile, Java web development, HTML5, Git, etc, I learned there. They also have a huge presence in the community and also influenced me to participate in Dojos and Meetups. Good memories, indeed. Firstly, I was supposed to help with the infra... as all the computers there had Ubuntu on it, it was a cool first experience handling Linux (in love with it since then). I was allowed to participate on courses with vacancy and I did a lot of them. Java, Java Web, EJB, JPA2, Agile, etc.

**Intern** - Brazilian Navy - September 2009 - March 2010

> I helped with the structural cabling and the computers maintenances. No code at all. Boring (and it didn't even count as activity hours for my tech highschool). But I learned a lot about basic infrastructure and a little bit about network. I've setup a Novel file server and a Lotus Notes mail server.
